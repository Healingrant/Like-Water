Nail that nagging plot thread off-screen somehow.
Nail that coffin now.
Just remember that bovine morsel with infectous ends.
Move on without letting go.
Move on and let go.
Make something fall off a cliff.
Trip on a new branch and gain momentum.
Is there such a thing?
Cut the strings.
Leave some monkeys adrift.
Look at it from the eyes of a cat.
Just add midgets!
Think like a lier and resolve the issue.
Tell everything In half truths.
Throw some feces at it.
Pull out now and save many lives.
Hide your morsels for a second pass.
Some dummies should remain dummies.
Light up a fire where no one wants one.
Let everyone in on the dirty secret without realizing it.
Hold back from spewing rhetoric and let your subconscious do the preaching.
Tether on the brink of Disneyland.
Think about it while you sleep.
How would this world act without your pet?
Use that to your advantage.
What song would inspire the scene?
Reach the point where even Hitler cries for mum.
Incite someone who wants to be left alone.
Make them impotent.
A man is crying somewhere.
Who has access to the gun?
Tear apart and rebuild.
ID the dummies and come back later to infect with AI.
What song chimes with this theme?
Time is relative and fragmentory: use it to your advantage.
Let madness be a virtue.
Expose with purpose.
Expose but reveal later.
Talk this out --especially in public.
Why are they on the pot --drugs or otherwise?
"If you lopped it off, would someone miss it?"
Shorten or cut.
Make superstition the trump card.
Sidestep the issue.
Use it to someone elses' advantage.
Elaborate then trim.
Isolated incident or rampant virus?
