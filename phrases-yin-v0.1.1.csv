Never make it easy: ######## 64/64
Don't start at the start:
Do you have too many guns?
There will always be loose ends.
Characters demand motives.
Still life exercise:
Time will tell your edifice.
Are they characters or just caricatures?
The middle of things is always the murkiest:
They want something.
Why is your character in a bathroom?
Why do you show them eating?
Where you nod off:
Unwaivering absolutes are poison.
Magnets! #######
